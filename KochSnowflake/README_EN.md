# Introduction
A program for creating a MATLAB package of Koch snowflakes, also known as the Koch fractal

The Koch curve is a fractal curve described in 1904 by the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch.

## Koch's Snowflake
Three copies of the Koch curve, constructed (with the points outward) on the sides of a regular triangle, <br /> 
and form a closed curve of infinite length, called the Koch snowflake.

The Koch curve is a typical geometric fractal. The process of its construction is as follows: we take a single segment, divide it into three equal parts and replace the middle interval with an equilateral triangle without this segment. As a result, a polyline is formed, consisting of four links of length 1/3. In the next step, we repeat the operation for each of the four resulting links, etc ... The limit curve is the Koch curve.

### Properties
- Paving with Koch snowflakes of two sizes
- The Koch curve is nowhere differentiable or straightenable.
- The Koch curve has infinite length.
- The Koch curve has no self-intersections.
- The Koch curve has an intermediate (that is, not an integer) Hausdorff dimension, which is equal to 4 l.\ lane 3, since it consists of four equal parts, each of which is similar to the entire curve with a similarity coefficient of 1/3.

Solving the problem using matlab. The number of iterations can be changed with the slider
```matlab
clc

x=[-1,0,1];             % X coordinates of the vertices of the original triangle
y=[0,sqrt(3),0];        % Y coordinates of the vertices of the original triangle
c=complex(x,y);         % transformation of each point into a complex number (so it is more convenient to calculate coordinates)
c(4)=c(1)
pause(1);
